# theodinproject-recipes

My journey starts here.

I started this project on 3rd September 2022 with minimal HTML/CSS knowledge,
after reading up about some basic tags and styling properties I decided to
give it a go and started creating my first website for the odin project.

After this recipe website project is finished,
it should show basic knowledge of HTML, some CSS and Git.
