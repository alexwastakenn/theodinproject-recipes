        My husband loved it. I added onions and celery. I cooked it in a slow cooker
        came out excellent
      </p>
      <p>
        I made it just like the recipe says and it was delicious! I did add crumbled
        bacon just before serving.

        Read the notes from others before making. I cut my potatoes a little larger
        and added celery along with the onions. I also added fresh corn. It was thick
        and delicious!
