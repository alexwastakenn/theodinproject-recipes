        I really did enjoy these bars. Made my own oat flour and in my oven, they
        were done in 30 minutes.

        Followed directions but made my own oat flour and had to use thawed
        blueberries, fresh would have been even better. These are fun to make and so
        delicious. I doubled the recipe and I am so glad I did; gone, gone, gone.
